cat ># Somatic Variant ML Pipeline - Model Performance

## Dataset Summary
- Total variants processed: 3
- Variants passing VAF filters: 2
- Genes annotated: TP53 (tumor suppressor), KRAS (oncogene)

## Feature Importance
- Gene role: 23.1% (highest importance)
- Quality score: 19.2%
- VAF ratio: 15.4%
- Tumor depth: 15.4%
- Transition status: 15.4%
- Tumor VAF: 11.5%

## Filtering Results
- PIK3CA variant filtered out (normal VAF 2.4% > 2% threshold)
- TP53 and KRAS variants retained as high-confidence somatic calls

## Biological Interpretation
The model correctly prioritizes gene context and VAF patterns for 
distinguishing somatic from germline variants in cancer samples.
